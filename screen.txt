Sometimes an app will freeze within a window
	Use `ctrl-a :kill` to, uh, unfreeze it :)

Use `ctrl-a |` to split screen vertically
	Use `ctrl-a S` to split screen horizontally
	Use `ctrl-a TAB` to move between panes
	If new pane is blank, use `ctrl-a c` to create a new window
	You can also `ctrl-a [1-0]` to switch that pane to an existing window
	You can switch between panes using `ctrl-a ctrl-a` as well
	Use `ctrl-a X` to close current pane

You can detach screen from the TTY without kill it with `ctrl-a X`
	You can reattach with `screen -r`
