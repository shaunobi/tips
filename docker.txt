Use the FROM instruction to base your docker build on a specific image
	For example: FROM ubuntu:20.04

Use the RUN instruction to create layers on top of the base image
	Note that this executes when the image is being built

Use the EXPOSE command to expose ports
	Need to pair this with a command line option as well [not sure why]

Use the CMD instruction to run something when container is launched
	The RUN instruction executes when the container is building
	This works similarly to: `sudo docker run -it container /bin/true`
	Note that a command line `run` command override a CMD instruction

To NOT have to use `sudo docker ...`, add your user to the docker group:
	`sudo groupadd docker`
	`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`

To list out images on local machine, `docker images`

To list out running containers, `docker ps`
	Use `docker ps -a` to show all containers, including stopped

Use `docker start container-name` and ` docker stop container-name` to start and stop
