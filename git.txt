Use `git checkout 1234567` to go back to a previous snapshot

Use `git revert 1234567` to "undo" the named commit
	Note that this is safe - it creates a NEW revision with the changes UNDONE
	So, history after would be: Create index.html, Revert "Create index.html"

Use `git checkout master` to go back to the master branch

Use `git log --online` and `git status` to see history and status

Use `git tab -a v1.x -m "message"` to create an annotated tag

Use `git checkout v1.x` to chack out a tagged snapshot (often a release)

I like to use `alias c=clear` so I can say `c;git status` on the terminal

To clean out changes to tracked files: `git reset --hard`
	Important: this will ONLY get rid of changes to tracked files, not untracked
	To get rid of untracked files: `git clean -f`
	Very important to be careful with these two commands
	They operate on the working directory, not committed snapshots
